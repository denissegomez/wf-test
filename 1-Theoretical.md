## Questions
- I can leave the field blank but validations will be done on submit. Is the field mandatory then?
- What is the length of the landline phone number?
- What is the expected format? (parentheses, dashes, spaces...)
- Should the prefix be in the same field of the landline number, or should it be a separate field?
- Aside of the prefix mandatoriness, the question about the field mandatoriness, and the rule of being different than the mobile phone, are there any other validations to be considered?
